# README

This is a direct port into rails of the code described in this [Heroku article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-websockets), which the original code can be found [here](https://github.com/heroku-examples/ruby-websockets-chat-demo). It's a bit rough, but if you read the original heroku article and want to get it going in Rails, this is a good place to start.

* run `bundle`
* run `puma -C config/puma.rb -p 3000`
* open your favorite browser and goto address: localhost:3000
* open your next favorite browser and goto address: localhost:3000
* start chatting!
